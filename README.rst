# featexp
Feature exploration for supervised learning. Helps with feature understanding, identifying noisy features, feature debugging, leakage detection and model monitoring.

featexp draws plots similar to partial dependence plots, but directly from data instead of using a trained model like current implementations of pdp do. 

Creates all partial dependence like plots for all deatures::
    sdf = 10
    fd=200
    
Thats all!
